  • Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?

DriverPass is a company that wants to help students pass their driving exam. They offer online practice tests as well as in-person
driver training. There are multiple driving packages that a student can choose from with different combinations of driving and test hours.
The company wanted a system where a student could sign up, make appointments with a driver, and view their tests and progress.


  • What did you do particularly well?

I feel I succeeded in creating a thorough and complete description of a process and object model for the DriverPass system. I included a description of
each process or object as well as its relationships and aggregation.


  • If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

One aspect of these documents I would revise is the option for customers to choose a driving package. In my model application paper, I would inlcude
processes and objects to represent the different packages offered and the actions included in choosing them. In my UML diagrams, I would include the
process of choosing a package and scheduling driving times based on the chosen package.


  • How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

The user's needs are essential to consider when creating a design. Becuase the system is being designed for the user, care must be taken to ensure that the
user's needs are met. They will be the ones accessing and using the system, so they must be able to understand how to use the system and what it does.
Designing a system without considering the user's needs will result in a system that is inaccessible and not useful for the user. This would be considered
a poor solution, as it would not provide solutions to the user's problems.


  • How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?

Before designing any code, the software should be thoroughly planned out. Determining the goals of the system first is helpful to ensure the design stays
focused on necessary elements. Necessary functions of the system should be determined as well as the nonfunctional and functional requirements,
limitations, assumptions, and user interface needs. Following the determination of requirements, UML diagrams can be created to visually represent and
understand the system processes and structure. Performing this analysis work before designing any code creates the most effective design. It is easier to
find superfluous code or avoid creating that code in the first place.
